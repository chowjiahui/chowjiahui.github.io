title: EDA on Drug Use and SAT scores
---

Second project - tests data preprocessing, correlation, and exploratory data analysis. First dataset of median drug use across ages in the US population taken from the US State of Health. Second dataset of average SAT scores in the US by state.
Python notebook here: <https://github.com/chowjiahui/Drug-Use---Exploratory-Data-Analysis/blob/master/project_2.ipynb>
This was done in January 2018. 

I explored a combination of swarm plots, box plots, and color to present data that is informative and multi-dimensional. Guiding questions are inserted as titles to graph plots.
