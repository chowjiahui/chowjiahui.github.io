---

Github project link (with more comprehensive description) can be found here: <https://github.com/chowjiahui/-isis>

I made a visualization of the ISIS twitter network, found here: <https://chowjiahui.github.io/ISISnetwork/>.

The project consists of networks analysis of the ISIS tweets to identify influential users who were important nodes for information spread in the network. 
The second part of the project uses NLP techniques to predict intent of tweets.
