title: Python Fundamentals
---

First project - tests python fundamentals, parsing of a csv file, and writing a search and filter function. Github project link here: <https://github.com/chowjiahui/Pokemon-Project/blob/master/project-1.ipynb>
This was done in December 2017. 

For the final question, I generated a power-law distribution graph in order to have a good visual sense of how the mean and standard deviation would affect the distribution. It might be a roundabout way to do it and I could have written the probability density function. But I wanted to visually verify that the parameters I used made sense.
